            <p><span class="coloredText">Firm</span></p>
            <p><span class="coloredText">Shelton, Mindel & Associates</span> is an architectural firm, established in 1978, providing complete architectural, interiors and product design services for corporate, cultural, academic, retail, recreational, hospitality and residential clients.</p> 
            
<p>The firm is the recipient of twenty-eight AIA awards for interior architecture, seven <i>Interior Design</i> magazine Best of Year awards for residential and commercial interiors; fourteen design awards from the Society of American Registered Architects, a Progressive Architecture citation, three Roscoe awards for product design, as well as three Good Design Awards and two American Architecture Awards from The Chicago Athenaeum. The American Institute of Architecture, San Francisco Museum of Fine Arts, National Academy of Design and Houston Museum of Fine Arts have exhibited the firm’s work in both traveling and permanent exhibitions.  Product design lines include collections for Knoll, Waterworks, Jack Lenor Larsen, V’Soske and Nessen Lighting.  <i>Architectural Digest</i> has recognized SMA as one of the top 100 design firms of the last century and Peter L. Shelton and Lee F. Mindel, FAIA were recognized as the Deans of American Design in 2005.  Both Peter L. Shelton and Lee F. Mindel, FAIA, have been inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame.</p>
          
<p>“Their renown has grown along with their client roster: Prominent shelter magazines frequently publish their residential projects, and it would be difficult to find a book on influential contemporary interiors that doesn’t mention their work. Their contract projects include ocean liners, the world’s largest disco, and corporate headquarters for Fila and Ralph Lauren... But regardless of the scale or nature of a project, they approach each one with the same discipline and insight, combining to achieve their trademark synthesis of architecture and design.” David Perrelli, <i>The Pennsylvania Gazzette</i></p>
